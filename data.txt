The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension.,Tisegnit n wuzzal tettali deg waman ɣef tmentilt n tussda n tjumma.

"Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.","Asanskrit d tutlayt iṣeεben nezzeh yerna d tanesbaɣurt, d ayen i tt-yeǧǧan ad tili d aɣbalu n waṭas n tutlayin Tihendiyin tattrarin, am Tlatinit i yellan d aɣbalu n tutlayin Tuṛufin am Tefransist d Tesbanyulit."
"With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.","Imi yefra umennuɣ n Franṣa, Lalman tebda tettheggay iman-is i wakken ad tenbez tigzirin n Briṭanya."
"Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.","Tsemma Lalman d angal tanṭagt ""Tamhelt Izem n Yilel"". Tuget n leslaḥ ẓayen d tmerna n Tredsa Tabriṭanit akk εerqen mi d-rewlen si Dunkirk, ihi taredsa d tanamumt."
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.,"Maca Taredsa Tageldant mazal-itt d tuntimt ugar ɣef Tegriwa Talalmanit (""Kriegsmarine"") yerna tella tezmer ad tesdegdeg yal tinawin n unbaz ad ceggεen izegren Ilel Aglizi."
"However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.","Maca, drus maḍi n yiɣeṛṛuba n Tegriwa Tageldant i yellan zdat n yiberdan n unbaz imi iqebṭanen ugaden ad ten-sɣerqen tinṭagin Tilalmaniyin n tegnawt."
"Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the ""little brother"" of Germany and Japan.","Iyyaw anebdu s usegzi ɣef yiɣuwas n Ṭelyan. Ṭelyan tella s wudem agejdan d ""gma-s amecṭuḥ"" n Lalman d Jabu."
"It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.","Sεan taredsa tanamumt d tagriwa tanamumt, ɣas akken bnan ukkuz n yiɣeṛṛuba imaynuten uqbel ad yebdu trad."
"Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.","Iswiyen igejdanen n Ṭelyan d timura n Tefriqt. I wakken ad ṭṭfen timura-agi, ilaq ad sεun tajumma n uceggeε n tekra, i wakken ad ssilelent tikra deg Yilel Amagrakal yerna ad nebzen Tafriqt."
"For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.","Γef waya, ilaq ad suffɣen izdaren Ibriṭaniyen d yiɣeṛṛuba si Maṣer. Ernu ɣer tigawin-agi, iɣeṛṛuba n umennuɣ n Ṭelyan ur nwin ad xedmen acemma niḍen."
"Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.","Tura ad nezzi ɣer Jabu. Jabu d tamurt tigzirt, am Briṭanya."
"Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.","Tineṭṭabin d iɣeṛṛuba sugnen i wakken ad inigen ddaw n waman, yerna ad qqimen din akud ɣezzifen."
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.,Tineṭṭabin ttwasxedment di Trad Amaḍlan I d Trad Amaḍlan II. Di tallit-nni ttmurḍusent mliḥ yerna sεant annar n ujbad bu tilas.
"In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.","Di tazwara n trad unagen s tuget ɣef yilel, maca mi d-yennefla umaṭṭaf yerna yuɣal d usdid tineṭṭabin terra-tent tmara ad ruḥent ddaw n waman i wakken ur tent-id-ttwalin ara."

"Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.","Imi rebḥen s tneṭṭabin-nsen, seld trad Ilalmaniyen ur tsamnen ara i wakken ad sen-ǧǧen aṭas seg-sen."
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as ""King Tut"" or ""The Boy King"", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.","Ih!

"Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.","S wudem inefεen, ur t-ḥsiben ara d win yesεan akka azal meqqren deg tallit taqburt yerna ur t-kelsen ara deg wumuɣen n yigelliden iqburen akk."
"However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.","Maca, tagrut n uẓekka-s di 1922 terra-t d bu tamelt. Γas akken llan aṭas n yiẓekwan n yizri i ukren, aẓekka-agi yeqqim akken yella."
"Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.","Tuget n yiferdisen i meḍlen akked Tutankamun qqimen akken, am agim n wallalen yettwaxedmen s yemɣuzen imazalen d yeẓra yenuqqan."
"The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.","Asnulfu n rwaḍi n waqqaṛen rran iceryunen Issiryanen d ixfifanen, d iruraden, d wid iwejden ugar i wakken ad zwaren iserdasen d yicaryunen niḍen."
"Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.","Tineccabin seg wallalen n ujbad ineqqen zemrent ad kecment taderraεt n yiserdasen imenzaɣen. Tamudi 1000 Uqbel. Tamasiḥt., Issiryanen skecmen-d tamnayit tamenzut."
"A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.","Tamnayit d taredsa yettnaɣen ɣef uεrur n yiεidiwen. Tarikt urεad i d-tennulfa, ihi tamnayit Tassiryanit tennuɣ ɣef uεrur imsuray n yiεidiwen-nsen."
"We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.","Nessen aṭas n yimsertiyen, imussnawen, d yinaẓuren Igrigiyen.

"Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.","Tamudi n tasut tis 15, Tistunit n ugafa tella ddaw n tezrirt tadelsant n Lalman."

"It was based on the German alphabet and one character ""Õ/õ"" was added.","Tebna ɣef ugemmay Alalmani d tmerniwt n yiwen n usekkil ""U/u""."
"As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment.","Skud yettaẓ wakud, aṭas n wawalen i d-reḍlen si Tlalmanit i d-sdukklen. D wagini i d tazwara n ussifaw."

This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.,Wagi ittwaxdem iwakken ad yeǧǧ tugna ad teddel akk agdil. Qqaren-as asemɣer s waṭas.

"Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which extends beyond a traveller's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.","Tikebbaniyin n uḥewwes llant si lqaṛn wis 19.

It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar trips to yours.,Izmer ad ilhu usexdem n tkebbanit n uḥewwes i yezgan tettheggi-d inigen am win tebɣiḍ.
"Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.","Wali acu n yinigen i tettdellil tkebbanit, ama di tansa-nes n anternet ama di ṭaq n tḥanutt-is."

"In many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle the registration (make sure to ask).","Deg waṭas n tmura isɛan aṣaḍuf-agi, xeddmen ajerred isensa idiganen (seqsi-d)."
"In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.

Unwanted murals or scribble is known as graffiti.,Unuɣ ɣef leḥyuḍ neɣ tira ur nettwabɣa ara tettwassen s yisem n grafiti.

"When a small group of living things (a small population) gets separated from the main population that they came from (like if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.","Mi akken agraw amecṭuḥ n imudar (kra imezdaɣ) tebḍa ɣef ugdud i deg d-tekka (am wakken zegren idurar neɣ assif, neɣ ruḥen ɣer tegzirt niḍen anda ur zmiren ara ad uɣalen ɣer deffir ), ad afen iman-nsen deg yiwet n twennaṭ yemgaraden ɣef tin i deg llan uqbel."

Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.,Tuget n yizudaɣ i qrib ad ɣlin n wadeg εawden-asen lebni i wakken ad sεun imerrayen tikti tamawayt ɣef wamek i d-banen di laṣel.

"For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.","D amedya, talɣa n useknew n tugniwin tusbiḍin tamagnut akk deg umaḍal d 35mm, i yellan d azal agejdan n usaru ɣer taggara n tallit n usarug arwasan."
"It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.","Mazal er tura ttfarasen-tent, maca s wudem axatar ugar timeẓri-ines n teɣzi d tehri yewwi-t-id si talɣiwin n yimaṭṭafen n tweṣṣafin tumḍinin."
"The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width by 24mm in height.","Talɣa n 35mm d tidet, ɣas akken d ayen yessewhamen, 36mm di tehri ɣef 24mm di teɣzi."
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.,Timeẓri n teɣzi d tehri n talɣa-agi (ẓun s mraw d sin i wakken ad ssawḍen uṭṭun ummid n ufmiḍi afessas akk) ihi nan-d d akken d 3:2.

"Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.","Ciṭ kan seld mi bdant tenṭagin, Briṭanya tergel-as abrid n tegriwa i Lalman."
"The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.","Aɣawas yeffeɣ-d d amellil, s ugzam n tmerna n yiserdasen d iɣaṛimen ilaqen, ɣas akken argal-agi n ubrid yeffeɣ akk i uṣaduf agraɣlan iqeblen s umata i sneglen waṭas n yemsisan di snat n tsutin-agi yezrin."

"He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.","Yewweḍ ɣer Yiwunak Yedduklen s 4 durru ɣef yisem-is, adlis n tmedyazt, d tabrat n uweṣṣi sɣur Čarls Bačlur (amsefrek-is deg uxeddim-is aqbur) ɣer Tumas Edisun."
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty.,Ccinwa taqburt tesεa tamamekt taselyant i wakken ad mlen talliyin n wakud yemgaraden; yal amecwaṛ n Ccinwa neɣ yal tawacult i yellan deg leḥkem d tallit tageldant tusdidt.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch taking place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.,Daɣen gar snat n talliyin tigeldanin yella-d wakud ur nerkid n temnaḍin yebḍan.

Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira‘” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.,"Muḥemmed yerra lwehla-s mliḥ ɣer isental beṛṛa n tudert-is n menwala. Yella yettruḥu ɣer yefri isem-is ""Hira"" deg Udrar n ""Nur"" (tafat) i wakken ad iḥekker."

"Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.","Imi d-yella ɣef tqacuct n yiwen seg yidurar n ugafa n Mekka, ifri tettwaεzel s wudem ummid seg umaḍal."
"In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.","S tidet, ur tezmireḍ ara ad t-tafeḍ akk ɣas lukan yella win yeẓran yella. Mi ara tiliḍ s daxel n yifri, d aεzal ummid."
"Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.

The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.,Tazamugt Tameqqrant di Giza d tawḥidt seg ṣa n texlafin i mazal tbedd er ass-a.

"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.","Tabraḥt n Giza, neɣ ""Timeqbeṛt Giza"" deg Uẓaɣar Tamaṣrit n Wid Yemmuten yesεa aṭas n tzumag (anda tella tzamugt tameqqrant d tin imeqqren akk), aṭas n yiẓekwan imecṭaḥ, aṭas n yifakan, d Usfinks ameqqran."
"The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.","Tazamugt tameqqrant tettwabna i wakken ad arren iseɣ i Uferεun Xufu, ma d waṭas n tzumag timecṭaḥ, iẓekwan, d ifakan ttwabnan i wakken ad arren iseɣ i tlawin d iεeggalen n twacult n Xufu."
"The ""up bow"" mark looks like a V and the ""down bow mark"" like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.","Ticreṭ n ""tganza n ufella"" tettban am V ma d ""ticreṭ n tganza n wadda"" tettban am txellalt neɣ amkuẓ i wumi ixuṣ yidis-is n wadda."
"Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.","D assawen anamek-is ilaq ad tebduḍ seg yixf dɣa ad tetekkiḍ ɣef tganza, ma d akessar anamek-is ilaq ad tebduḍ seg ugru (anda yeṭṭef ufus-ik taganza) tjebḍeḍd taganza."

"Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.","Timḥettemt tatiknulujit d awal i yesdukklen agraw wessiɛen n tektiwin deg unnar n uṭebbeq, seg udegger-atiknuluji neɣ lmeḥwiǧat n tetiknulujit ɣer lmeɛna id-iqqaren belli lmektub n wemdan tselḥuy-it tmeẓla tagejdant iqqnen ɣer isuḍaf ussnanen akked ubani-nsen di tetiknulujit."
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.","Amur ameqqran n usmedya n temḥettemt tatiknulujit cerken snat n tektiwin timatuyin: belli anerni n tetiknulujit s timmad-is itabaɛ abrid ibaɛden s waṭas ɣef tezrirt n yidles neɣ n tsertit, yarna tatiknulujit-agi daɣen tesɛa ""isemda"" ɣef tmettiyin i yellan d igejdanen, mačči d wid ittucaṛḍen s wudem ametti."
"For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.","Amedya, nezmer ad n-ini belli takeṛṛust ileḥḥun s umutur tegla-d s usnerni n iberdan."

"In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.","Deg usatal n Trumansit, tarakalt temsel imdanen, yerna s wakud insayen d yidles icudden ɣer trakalt banen-d, yerna wigi, imi sεan amekkan-nsen deg tmetti, ifen iṣudaf yettwaḥettmen kan akka."
"In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.","Akken tettwassen Paris d tamanaɣt n waɣan n umaḍal azi, Kunstantinubl ttwalin-tt d tamanaɣt n waɣan n Tuṛuft tabukalt."

"One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.","Yiwet si tarrayin timagnutin akk yettwasxedmen i wakken ad d-nesmedya azal n usmetti d tumla n kra n tejṛutin yettuɣaḍen n warrac imecṭaḥ i, s ustehzi, lexṣaṣ n zher, neɣ tameḥqranit s lebɣi, ur ten-smettin ara imengaḍen mi ttimɣuren."
"Such children are called ""feral"" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.","Arrac imecṭaḥ am wigi qqaren-asen d ""imulasen"" neɣ d iweḥciyen.

"Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone.","Imεiwnen uhlisen llan deg useɣzan yerna llan i wakken ad steqsin, sḥercen, akked ad segzun tisekkirin iweεṛen i yinelmaden ad tent-fehmen s yiman-nsen."
"Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.","Igerdan ttilin deg Ixxamen n Twaculin niḍen ɣef waṭas n ssebbat tanḍiyin seg ustehzi, tamuḥqranit, ula ɣer tukksa."
"No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.","Ur yelli ugrud ilaqen ad yimɣur deg uxxam anda ulac leḥmala, aseḥbiber, d usinen, maca nutni ddren akka."
We perceive the Foster Care System to be a safety zone for these children.,Nettwali d akken Anagraw n Twaculin Yettrebbin d adeg yesεan taɣellist i yigerdan-agi.
"Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.","Anagraw-nneɣ n twaculin yettrebbin tiṭ-is ad yefk ixxamen yesεan taɣellist, imejjayen yesεan tayri, asinen irekden, d asejji bu taflest."

The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.,Internet yesdukkel iferdisen n teɣwalt n waṭas n lɣaci d tin gar yemdanen.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.,Tulmisin tufṛizin n Internet ṣṣawaḍent ɣer tsektiwin timernanin deg wayen yeεnan tudsa n useqdec akked taḍfi.
"For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).","D amedya, ""almad"" d ""wesmetti"" summren-ten am isguffden ixataren i useqdec n Internet (James d wiyaḍ., 1995)."
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.,"""Attekki udmawan"" d ""wassaɣen imaɣlalen"" ula d nutni ukzen-ten d timeẓṛa timaynutin n wesguffed sɣur Aymi d MakKurd (1998) mi ḥettcen tisedmirin ɣef yismal web."
"The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements which last a few milliseconds.","Asexdem n usekles ufidyu yegla-d s tegrutin tixatarin di lefhama n tenfaliyin-timecṭaḥ, imbiwlen n wudem i yettdummun kra n tasinin timecṭaḥ maḍi."
"In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.","Ladɣa, qqaren-d d akken yezmer ad nẓer ma yella yeskiddib umdan s lefhama akken iwata n tenfaliyin timecṭaḥ maḍi."
"Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.","Ulifer Saks, deg lkaɣeḍ-is Inaw n Uselway, yemla-d amek imdanen ur nezmir ad fehmen inaw acku yettwaɣ wallaɣ-nsen zemren ihi ad ssitgen tidet s tiseddi."

Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.,Anadi n tasut tis snat n tmerwin yemla-d d akken llan sin n yinawen n ubeddel ajini: udrig d aεinani.
"Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.","Tiḍermas rnant-d abeddel ajini, ma d afran yettekkses-it seg unaw n ubeddel εinani."
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.,Beṭṭu d wallus n usdukkel rwin abeddel seg wanaw ɣer wayeḍ gar sin n wanawen s yal tasuta.
"Out on the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.","Beṛṛa di teẓgi, yewεeṛ lḥal i yebki s unagraw n uεebbuḍ-is yeẓẓaḍen am win n wulsiyen i wakken ad yeṣṣaweḍ ayen i d-yeḍleb aminu-acid s yemɣan yellan."
"Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.","Ernu ɣer waya, ma yella ur ṣṣawḍen ara ad xedmen ayagi ad yexleq inelkimen meqqren: anezgum n temɣer, laẓ, d taggara-nsen d tamettant."
"The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.","Imɣan yellan akk i zemren ad d-afen d ibrutinen yellan deg iferrawen d lxeḍra, maca wigi ur yezmir uεebbuḍ-nneɣ n yibkan am nukni ad ten-yexdem siwa ma yella wwan."
"In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.","D anemgal, učči n yiɣersiwen (tiweḍfin, ibaεεac, d tmellalin) mačči kan yeẓẓaḍ-iten uεebbuḍ s tefses, maca ččuren d yibrutinen n tɣara εlayen yesεan akk aminu-asids ilaqen."
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.","Ma yella neṭṭef akk tiɣawsiwin, ur nwehhem ara ma yella lejdud-nneɣ ufan-d ixf i ""yiɣeblan-nsen n yibrutinen"" s yiwet n tmamekt akken xeddmen icambunziyen tura deg teẓgi."
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).,Aḥbas n yiḍes d akala n tnekra s lebɣi deg tallit n yiḍes amagnu akked yiḍes ciṭ n wakud kan sakkin (10-60 n tesdatin).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.,Ay-agi tzemreḍ ad t-xedmeḍ s usexdem n umsaki ur nxeddem ara aṭas n ṣṣut i wakken ad k-id-yawi ɣer tefrit mebla ma yessaki-k-id.
"If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.","Ma yella tufiḍ iman-ik tettalseḍ acεal n umsaki deg iḍeṣ-ik, tzemreḍ ad t-terreḍ deg yidis nniḍen n texxamt, d ayen ad k-yeǧǧen ad tekkreḍ i wakken ad t-tessexṣiḍ."
"Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.","Tibdal niḍen yebnan ɣef tebyuritm d tissit n waṭas n waman (ladɣa aman neɣ latay, adyuritik yettwassnen) send iḍes, d ayen ad ak-yeǧǧen ad d-kkreḍ i wakken ad tbecceḍ."
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in one’s body and spirit.,Afmiḍi n talwit n daxel i yesεa umdan tcudd s wudem anmengal ɣer ufmiḍi n waddad deg tfekka n umdan d wallaɣ-is.
"The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.","Simmal yettenqas waddad, simmal tettili tudert d tilawt. Yal amdan yezmer ad yaf talwit d tumert."
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.,Yal yiwen deg-neɣ yezmer ad yaweḍ ɣer tafat. Yiwet n tɣawsa kan ireglen abrid ɣer yiswi-agi d addad-nneɣ d tibawt-nneɣ.

"In principle the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.","Di laṣel Abbudi Atibitan d aḥerfi mliḥ. D Ayuga Akundalini, ddeεwat d ubrid n yakk tayri i d-yezzin."
"With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.","Akked Uyuga Akundalini ssehḍ Akurdalini (ssehḍ n tafat) yekker-d s tiɣimitin n Yuga, irmuden n uneffes, mantras d tmuɣliwin."
"The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.","Ammas n uweḥḥed Atibitan d Ayuga n Yillu.

"Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and USA. With the end of the war the clashes of system, process and culture led to the countries falling out.","Lalman d acengu icerken deg Trad Amaḍlan 2, d ayen i d-yeglan s tdukkli gar Russ d Yiwunak Yedduklen.

"However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet's Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.","Maca, iɣawasen-agi qedmen gar yiḍ d wass, anda 800,000 n yiserdasen seg Tredsa Tazewwaɣt n Tdukkla Tasufyit kecmzn yerna xelqen-d inekcumen n Belarussi d Ukren seld mi nebzen tamiwin n usamar n Buland s uεfas n Umsisi n Talwit Riga, Arkawal n War-takeṛṛiḍt n Sufyit-Buland, d yemsisiyen igraɣlanen niḍen, wid yesεan sin n yidisen d wid yesεan ugar n yidisen."

Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.,Ibardan n tcaṛiḍin ttwabnan di Legliz di Lqaṛn wis 16.
"Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.","Xas akken ibardan n tcaṛiḍin sɛan kan tilwiḥin n usɣaṛ imqabalen, ǧǧant iɛidiwen itent-ittseḥḥiben ad siwḍen ɣer tɣawla tameqqrant yarna ad seḥben taẓeyt tameqqrant kter n ibardan ur naɛdil ara deg wass."
"Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top.","Tilwiḥin n webrid kecment-d zik iwakken ad ṭṭfent iran n webrid deg umekkan-nsen.

"This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.","Aya-gi yuɣal d ccɣel imucaɛen, maca uzzal-nni isett rwadi n usɣaṛ n ticaṛiḍin."
"Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.","Ɣer taggara, rwadi n usɣaṛ ttwabeddlent s rwadi n wuzzal. Di 1767, lulen-d ibardan n wuzzal s lekmal."

"Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually.","Lejdud-nsen, Ustralubitaken ur leḥḥun ara s ibeddi am akken nuɣ tannumi."

This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.,D tamamekt taxatart i wakken ad tferqeḍ gar kra n yimyagen d yisemmaden.

Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian since most words are pronounced exactly how they are written,Asenṭeq yeshel ciṭ s Tṭelyanit imi tuget n wawalen ssenṭaqen-ten-id akken ten-ttarun.
"The main letters to watch out for are c and g, since their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.","Isekkilen igejdanen ilaq ad tḥadreḍ d c d g, imi asenṭeq-nsen yemgarad ɣef leḥsab n tiɣṛi i d-iteddun."
"Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, whereas carro means chariot.","Daɣen, tḥeq d akken tesneṭqeḍ-d r d rr s wudem amgarad: karu anamek-is aεziz, ma d karru anamek-is aceryun."
